# Description
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either real or fake. The process involves:

1.Data preprocessing including text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming.

2.Visualization of data using word clouds and frequency analysis.

3.Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

4.Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Scikit-learn

Seaborn

Matplotlib

WordCloud

# Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk scikit-learn wordcloud

# Usage

1.Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/Manoj-kumarv/Fake-News-Detection-System.git

Download the dataset and place it in the /content directory.

2.Data

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing news articles labeled as "Real" or "Fake". The relevant columns used for this analysis include:

text: The article content.

class: The label indicating whether the article is real (1) or fake (0).

# Results

The performance of the model can be evaluated using the accuracy score and confusion matrix. The Logistic Regression model and Decision Tree model were both tested, with accuracy scores reported for both training and testing datasets.

# Example Outputs
Logistic Regression Accuracy:

Training Accuracy: X%

Testing Accuracy: Y%

Decision Tree Accuracy:

Training Accuracy: A%

Testing Accuracy: B%

Confusion matrices visualizing model predictions will also be displayed as part of the output.
